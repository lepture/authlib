Version 1.0.0
-------------

**Released on Mar 15, 2022.**

We have dropped support for Python 2 in this release. We have removed
built-in SQLAlchemy integration.

**OAuth Client Changes:**

The whole framework client integrations have been restructured, if you are
using the client properly, e.g. ``oauth.register(...)``, it would work as
before.

**OAuth Provider Changes:**

In Flask OAuth 2.0 provider, we have removed the deprecated
``OAUTH2_JWT_XXX`` configuration, instead, developers should define
`.get_jwt_config` on OpenID extensions and grant types.

**SQLAlchemy** integrations has been removed from Authlib. Developers
should define the database by themselves.

**JOSE Changes**

- ``JWS`` has been renamed to ``JsonWebSignature``
- ``JWE`` has been renamed to ``JsonWebEncryption``
- ``JWK`` has been renamed to ``JsonWebKey``
- ``JWT`` has been renamed to ``JsonWebToken``

The "Key" model has been re-designed, checkout the :ref:`jwk_guide` for updates.

Added ``ES256K`` algorithm for JWS and JWT.
